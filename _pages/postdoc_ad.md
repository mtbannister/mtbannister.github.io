I welcome applications for a postdoctoral research position to explore questions around the role of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01910">interstellar objects</a> in stellar and planetary <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04451">system formation<a>.

A wide range of expertise is relevant, potentially including planetary, stellar, Galactic studies or even high-performance computing; this position is ideal for a researcher looking to branch out into a rapidly developing new area of astronomy.

The focus of this position will be simulation of the collapse and stellar/planetary system formation of molecular clouds containing a population of interstellar objects. 
Initial hydrodynamic simulations in the Python-based AMUSE framework have shown remarkably promising results. 
This project will springboard established AMUSE code to explore a detailed physical parameter space, in close collaboration with theorist colleagues in Europe. 

You will also be encouraged to pursue independent research, and mentor more junior colleagues in areas of your skillsets and expertise overlapping with the group.
The UC planetary group has wide-ranging interests broadly focussed on Solar System formation and evolution, including both observational and theoretical approaches. 
International collaborations include the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/index.html">Vera Rubin Observatory</a>, <a href="http://www.ossos-survey.org/">OSSOS</a>/<a href="https://www.colossos.net/">Colours of OSSOS</a>, <a href="https://www.ssols.space/">SSOLS</a>, and planetary missions including ESA's <a href="https://www.cometinterceptor.space/">Comet Interceptor</a> and NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart/">DART</a>.
Observing time and teaching roles, if desired, with UC's Mt John Observatory at Takapō are also available.

The two-year position in Christchurch is available from Feb 2021 onward.
Salary from July 1 2021 is $75,000 NZD for the first year, and $80k for the second year.
You must have earned a PhD in a related field by your start date. 
If currently overseas, the successful candidate will need to meet immigration requirements, as the NZ border is currently on <i><a href="https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/covid-19/border-closures-and-exceptions#who-can-come">highly limited entry</a></i>, including post-arrival quarantine.

The UC planetary group values work-life balance, and is committed to making the culture and community of the planetary science field a supportive and welcoming place for all.
People from historically underrepresented groups and communities are particularly encouraged to apply.
Christchurch | Ōtautahi is a <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/life/christchurch/">pleasant city</a> with easy access to nearby mountains and coast, and has a <a href="https://www.christchurch.space/">growing aerospace community</a>.

Prospective candidates are encouraged to contact Dr Michele Bannister (michele.bannister@canterbury.ac.nz) for further information or with any questions, with an email title containing 'Interstellar postdoc'.

Prompt application is appreciated; application by Jan 14 is encouraged for full consideration. Interviews will begin from Jan 18.

<b>To apply:</b>
send the following items to Dr Michele Bannister (michele.bannister@canterbury.ac.nz):
* A one-page cover letter — noting your thoughts about skillsets or expertise relative to the project focus. 
* CV — please include both any publications and/or work and achievements that you are enthusiastic about, but that may not easily fit within traditional metrics of academic success
* A two-page research statement — figures welcome
* Include only the contact details of three referees: no letters required initially
