The small worlds of the Solar System provide insights into its early history.
As a planetary astronomer, I am interested in understanding how they formed, evolved and reached their present orbits.
I use wide-field imaging surveys to discover minor planets, and large telescopes to understand their surfaces.
I'm in the <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/phys-chem/">School of Physical and Chemical Sciences Te Kura MatÅ«</a> at the <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/">University of Canterbury</a> in New Zealand.
