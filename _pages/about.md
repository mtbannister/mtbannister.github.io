The small worlds of the Solar System provide insights into its early history.
As a planetary astronomer, I am interested in understanding how they formed, evolved and reached their present orbits.
I use wide-field imaging surveys to discover minor planets, and large telescopes to understand their surfaces.
* I'll be joining the faculty at the <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/">University of Canterbury</a> in New Zealand from February.
* A fully funded PhD position is available; contact me if interested.
