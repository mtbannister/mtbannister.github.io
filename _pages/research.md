* It's been a long road to discovering 840 minor planets beyond Neptune:

* On its brief passage by Earth, we found the colours of the first interstellar object, 1I/ʻOumuamua,
are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06214">like those seen in our outer Solar System</a>!
* Is there a distant giant planet in our Solar System, yet unseen?
Here's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05348">what new OSSOS discoveries can say</a>;
its signature on distant TNOs is <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06575">distinctive but very hard to spot</a> in past surveys.
The 20,000 year-long orbits of little worlds like 2013 SY99 may instead be from

                        My research aims to help build our understanding of the earliest history of our Solar System.
                        How did the planets form? Why do we see them in their current positions?
                        In the last fifteen years, our story of how our Solar System came to be in its present state
                        has altered dramatically - and this is largely due to knowing more about some of
                        the smallest worlds in our planetary system.

                    <div class="dcontent">
                        The formation of the planets left a population of remnant worlds orbiting on the outer edges
                        of the Solar System, in the vast spaces beyond Neptune. These small objects, no larger than
                        the state of Western Australia, have remained near-undisturbed on their orbits.
                        They offer a snapshot of the earliest times, and their existence places limits on the
                        potential migrations of the giant planets.

                    The first search for these distant worlds was made by a young astronomer, Clyde Tombaugh, in 1930.
                        His survey discovered Pluto; but it was not until the early 1990s that new surveys with
                        digital cameras discovered more such worlds, and began to show us the abundance
                        and diversity of Pluto's kin.

                        Our surveys at Siding Spring Observatory aimed to complete this emerging picture.
                        The Uppsala telescope observes every night as part of an ongoing program to detect
                        swift-moving near-Earth asteroids. For my PhD, I reprocessed five years of their observations
                        to look for the much slower motion of large, bright trans-Neptunian objects.

                <div class="dcontent">
                The dwarf planet Haumea is the parent of a collisional family that includes its two moons, Hi'iaka and Namaka. The orbits of the moons of this strange dwarf planet are currently lined up so that from our view here on Earth, they eclipse Haumea itself. This alignment will persist only for another year or so, then not recur for another 300 years. As part of an international collaboration, I am <a href='http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/2003EL61/mutual/'>trying to observe</a> these rare events: they could allow us to very accurately calculate the shape of Haumea, which spins so fast that it is warped out into the form of a rugby ball.

                <div class="dcontent">
                As the solar wind bombards the surface of our Moon, it embeds fragments of the raw stuff of the Sun into particles of metal in the lunar soil. Some soil was brought back by the Apollo missions. By analysing these tiny particles with an ion microprobe, we can measure the proportions they hold of the two rare types of elemental oxygen. These proportions are different between the asteroids and the rocky planets. Will this measurement from the primordial source, the Sun, be able to change our understanding of how the planets formed? With <a href="http://shrimp.anu.edu.au/people/tri/tri.html">Trevor Ireland</a> of the <a href="http://rses.anu.edu.au/">Research School of Earth Sciences</a>, I analysed samples of lunar soil returned by the Apollo missions.

                <div class="dcontent">
                The arid and windswept McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are carpeted with the polygons of <span class="italics">patterned ground</span>, a geological formation that is also seen on the northern plains of the planet Mars. The polygons, photographed here by me in Victoria Valley, develop over thousands of years.<br/><br/>
                        My Honours research involved nine weeks of fieldwork in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica with K054, split between Victoria Valley and Beacon Valley. I worked to understand the influence that buried masses of ice have on the development of patterned ground. By looking below the surface with geophysical methods, we can map out the buried ice and the wedges of ice that grow downward to separate out each polygon. This will help us to better understand the patterned ground of Mars.
